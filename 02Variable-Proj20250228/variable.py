a=10
b=10

# prints the value of variable a and b
print(a,b)  #10 10

# prints the location of the value 10 in the memory
print(id(a),id(b)) # since value of variable a and b is same i.e. 10 so '10' has the location for both a and b "140721980507336 140721980507336"

#prints a as the string and b is refering to the value 10 so prints 10
print("a",b)
